<p>A simple standalone application</p>
<p>Three distinct layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front end</li>
<li>Back End</li>
<li>Data Store</li>
</ul>
<p>As product features start to multiply</p>
<ul>
<li>Code complexity increases</li>
<li>Operational work increases (Dev Ops)</li>
<li>Product Hits Scalability Limits</li>
<li>Developers write huge amount of tests as quality gates</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications in this state are called &lsquo;Monoliths&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each microservice is autonomous, self contained and individually deployable and scalable.</p>
<p>Each Feature can be a microservice.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-for-microservices">Challenges for Microservices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Efficientcy.</li>
<li>Programming complexity. (Compartmentalisation key to managing)</li>
<li>Synchronisation Primatives - mutexes and Semaphores (Deadlocks)</li>
<li>Priority Inversion - High priority process wait on Low Priority Process</li>
<li>Starvation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="golang-to-solve-these-challenges">Golang to solve these challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code becomes hard to read and poorly documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracts between components cannot be easily inferred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Builds are slow. The development cycles of code-compile-test grow in difficulty,with inefficiency in modeling concurrent systems, as writing efficient code with synchronization primitives is tough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manual memory management often leads to bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are uncontrolled dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a variety of programming styles due to multiple ways of doing
something, leading to difficulty in code reviews, among other things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>
<p>With shared memory its easy to get deadlocks or corruption if a process crashes or misbehaves.</p>
<p>CSP promotes messaging using channels queues with a logical inteface of send() and recv()</p>
<p>First class channels. (First Class Go Primatives)
Proceedures called go routines.</p>
<h2 id="garbage-collection">Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>In a concurrent system garbage collection is a must have feature</p>
<h2 id="object-orientation">Object Orientation</h2>
<p>Go way is composition over inheritance
For Polymorphic Behavior Go uses interfaces and duck typing.</p>
<h2 id="pacakging-code">Pacakging Code</h2>
<p>encapsulationâ€”packaging code into a higher level of abstractions</p>
<ul>
<li>Object orientation in go</li>
<li>Code layout of packages, dependencies</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contracts-key-aspect-of-module-design">Contracts key aspect of module design</h3>
<p>Formalized Documentation documenetation of an interaction with a software component.
(Durable, Versioned, Service Level Agreements)</p>
<h2 id="object-orientation-in-go">Object Orientation in Go</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Class is a blueprint or template for objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions invoke behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encapsulation - implies exposing a contract (inteface) for the behavior of objects and hides implementation details. (Private attributes and methods)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inheritance (is-a relationship) can lead to a hieraechy of classes that can be hard to debug.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>This ability of an interface method to behave differently based on the actual object is called polymorphism (derived classes &lt;- Super class)

An alternative to inheritance is to delegate behavior, also called composition has-a relationship

Classes implement an interfaceâ€”which is the contract the base class offers.
Functionality reuse happens through having references to objects, rather than
deriving from classes.

Golang favours composition over inheritance.
</code></pre><hr>
<ul>
<li>THe Struct - equivelent container for encapsulation.
Methods hava a receiver clause (Method Set)</li>
<li>pointer receiver - pass by refernce</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>non - pointer receiver pass by reference</li>
<li>slices and maps act as a reference pass them as a value will allow mutation of the objects.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Visibility - struct field with a lowercase letter is private.
(Public struct field code outside package can reference.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Interface - Interface construct key to polymorhism in go
Objects that implement all the interface methods
automatically implement the interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embedding - is a mechanism to allow the ability to borrow pieces from different classes.
Let&rsquo;s call Base , struct embedded into a Derived struct.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This may feel like inheritance, but embedding does not provide polymorphism. Embedding
differs from subclassing in an important way: when a type is embedded, the methods of
that type are available as methods of the outer type; however, for invocation of the
embedded struct methods, the receiver of the method must be the inner (embedded)
type, not the outer one
(Can also be done on interfaces)
multiple inheritences -deadly diamond of death</p>
