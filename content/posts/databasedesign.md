## Entity Relationship Models

DBMS
- data
- information
- knowledge 
- intelligence (value of data) 

From data to actionable insights 

File System Solution
- Separated, isolated data and data duplication
- Dependancy on applications 
- Incompatible files
- Lack of data sharing 

Database Solution
- A structure that contains data
- Organise data through entities, attributes, relationships
- Collection of programs that users interact with a database.

Popular DBMS
- Microsoft Access
- MySql
- Progres
- MongoDb (NoSql) 

Advantages 
- more information from same amount of data 
- share our data 
- balancing conflicting requirements 
- controlling redundacy 
- consistency 
- Referential integrity
- expanding security
- increasing productivity
- providing data independence.


Disaadvantages
- Complex
- Greater Impact of Failure 
- More differcult recovery
- Larger file size (Also structure, user and application)

When is a DBMS not appropriate - when advantages outweigh disadvantages
- Database small with simple structure
- Applications are simple and relatively static
- Applications have real time requirements 
- Concurrent, multi access to data not required
